This lab asked us to use tables and become more comfortable with files.
We were asked to assign names, from the three lists provided, to tables. So, when someone
typed in which file they wanted to read, the names would appear with the location of the seats.
The main functions in the code were opening and reading the file of the user input and assigning tables.
I didn't help much with the code this week and I didn't understand how to do the code. I understood what we were asked
and what steps would be taken to get there, but I couldn't figure out how to write it in code.
