In this lab, we were tasked with creating a program that could read a given .txt file and create a seating chart for five-person tables based on the list.
In completing this task, we wrestled extensively with working with external files and correct importation of variables between functions.
The process involved mapping out the start and end of the project and then trying  to figure out the necessary steps in order to make the ends meet.
Once this was done, we used primarily prerequisite knowledge of variable importing and exporting variables, creating and editing lists, and using data within external files.
The results weren't exactly what I anticipated them to be in the end. I ultimately had to improvize, as I could not get some of the elements of my code, mainly variable exportation, to work without them.
The main challenge came from trying to apply lessons from when I could not physically be in class due to being ill. This can in the form of figuring out using external files.
In the end, I managed to figure it out by backtracking through the class notes and following the examples in the "class code" on GitHub.
A key takeaway for me was just not to be afraid not to backtrack or questions yourself. Generally you don't know the answers immediately, so you need to refresh yourself.
I'd like to think I learned what I was supposed to, but in truth, needing to improvize to come to the end solution might mean that I didn't.
My partner, as they did for lab 6, did not do any work on this project. All the coding and writing was performed solely by me up to this point.
This was obviously frustrating, because this particular assignment is impactful on my grade in a way that the others haven't been, potentially righting a wrong in my gradebook, ironically being the other lab I worked on with this same partner.
This isn't the first time this has happened, as I had a similar experience working with Megan Wijdoogen, but this time it feels particularly frustrating due to the stakes.
